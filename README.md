# Amazon Kindle Fire Price Drop Notifier

This project monitors the price of the Kindle Fire on Amazon and sends an automated notification when the price drops by a specified threshold.

## How the Application Works

Here's the workflow:

### 1. Periodic Price Checks
The script runs at configurable intervals using a scheduler. Each cycle:

- Fetches product pages using HTTP requests with proxies of bright data (Have already done with custom headers on the Python project so don't use it here)
- Parses HTML content with Cheerio to extract pricing data
- Gets exact price from Amazon through request retries

### 2. Price Comparison
- Compares current price with historical data (current, average, highest, lowest prices) stored in MongoDB
- Triggers notifications if price drop exceeds the configured threshold

### 3. Notification
- Email and SMS notification

### 4. Clean UI for checking the products
